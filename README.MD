* `composer install`
* put wss (websocket url - can get that from chrome connection tab for example) into `connectionurl`
* have write access to local file `place.db`

Will connect to the given websocket and record the entries into a sql3 database.


Would be nice:

* properly setup project
* actually build a time lapse renderer
